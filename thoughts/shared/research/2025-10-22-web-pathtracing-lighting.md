# Path Tracing Lighting Methods for Web-Based 3D Rendering

**Research Date**: 2025-10-22
**Research Topic**: Web-based path tracing implementation approaches for enhanced photorealistic lighting
**Researcher**: Claude (SuperClaude Framework)

## Executive Summary

Path tracing is an advanced rendering technique that simulates physically accurate light transport by tracing rays of light as they bounce through a 3D scene. Unlike traditional rasterization (currently used in the 3D Model Viewer), path tracing produces photorealistic global illumination, accurate reflections, refractions, soft shadows, and caustics.

**Key Findings**:
- Two primary approaches exist: custom WebGL shaders vs. production-ready Three.js libraries
- three-gpu-pathtracer provides the most mature solution for Three.js integration
- Performance trade-offs: progressive rendering vs. real-time responsiveness
- Current 3D viewer uses rasterization + HDRI IBL; path tracing would be a significant upgrade

## Technical Analysis

### Path Tracing Fundamentals

**How Path Tracing Works**:
1. Shoot rays from camera into scene (one per pixel)
2. Trace ray bounces through scene (5-10 bounces typical)
3. At each bounce, sample direct light + material interaction
4. Accumulate color contributions along ray path
5. Repeat process with random sampling (Monte Carlo)
6. Average samples over time for progressive refinement

**Advantages over Rasterization**:
- Physically accurate global illumination (light bounces between surfaces)
- Realistic soft shadows from area lights
- Accurate reflections and refractions
- Natural caustics (light focused through transparent objects)
- No need for shadow maps, environment probes, or light baking

**Disadvantages**:
- Computationally expensive (many samples needed for clean image)
- Progressive rendering (image refines over time from noisy to clean)
- Not suitable for real-time interaction without compromises
- Requires modern GPU with WebGL 2.0 support

---

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Custom WebGL Path Tracer (evanw/webgl-path-tracing)

**Architecture**:
- Dynamic GLSL shader compilation
- Entire scene compiled into fragment shader
- Ray-triangle intersection in GPU
- 5 bounces per ray maximum

**Technical Details**:
```javascript
// Key features from analysis
- Surface types: diffuse, mirrored, glossy
- Soft shadows via random light jittering per pixel
- Continuous progressive rendering
- Realtime performance for simple scenes
```

**Code Structure**:
- `webgl-path-tracing.js` - Core path tracer
- `glUtils.js` - WebGL utilities
- `sylvester.src.js` - Vector/matrix math
- `index.html` - Demo interface

**Pros**:
- Full control over shader implementation
- Lightweight (minimal dependencies)
- Educational value for understanding path tracing

**Cons**:
- Requires shader recompilation on geometry/material changes
- Limited to simple scenes (shader compilation bottleneck)
- No production-ready features (denoising, adaptive sampling)
- Would require significant development effort

**Integration Effort**: High (8-12 weeks for production-ready implementation)

---

### Approach 2: three-gpu-pathtracer Library (RECOMMENDED)

**Architecture**:
- Built on top of three-mesh-bvh (Bounding Volume Hierarchy)
- WebGL 2.0 GPU-accelerated compute
- Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials
- GGX surface model for realistic reflections

**Key Features**:

1. **Progressive Rendering**:
```javascript
import { WebGLPathTracer } from 'three-gpu-pathtracer';

renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.toneMapping = THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping;

pathTracer = new WebGLPathTracer(renderer);
pathTracer.setScene(scene, camera);

function animate() {
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    pathTracer.renderSample(); // Renders one sample per frame
}
```

2. **Configuration Options**:
```javascript
pathTracer.bounces = 10; // Light bounce depth (default: 10)
pathTracer.renderScale = 1.0; // Resolution scaling
pathTracer.tiles = new THREE.Vector2(3, 3); // Tiled rendering
pathTracer.minSamples = 5; // Min samples before display
pathTracer.renderDelay = 100; // Delay before rendering starts
pathTracer.fadeDuration = 500; // Fade-in duration
pathTracer.filteredGlossyFactor = 0; // Firefly reduction
```

3. **Performance Optimization**:
```javascript
// Hybrid rendering: rasterize while path tracing
pathTracer.rasterizeScene = true; // Show rasterized preview

// Dynamic low-res rendering
pathTracer.dynamicLowRes = true;
pathTracer.lowResScale = 0.1; // 10% resolution for preview

// Tiled rendering for responsiveness
pathTracer.tiles = new THREE.Vector2(3, 3);
```

4. **Advanced Camera Effects**:
```javascript
import { PhysicalCamera } from 'three-gpu-pathtracer';

const camera = new PhysicalCamera();
camera.fStop = 1.4; // Aperture size (depth of field)
camera.focusDistance = 25; // Focus distance in meters
camera.apertureBlades = 6; // Bokeh shape
camera.apertureRotation = 0; // Bokeh rotation
camera.anamorphicRatio = 1.0; // Anamorphic stretch
```

5. **Material Extensions**:
```javascript
// Path tracing specific material properties
material.matte = false; // Render as transparent for compositing
material.castShadow = true; // Shadow casting control
material.envMapIntensity = 1.0; // HDRI intensity (already used)
```

6. **Environment & Lighting**:
```javascript
// Environment map integration
scene.environment = envMap; // Already used in current viewer
pathTracer.updateEnvironment(); // Update after changing env

// Light updates
pathTracer.updateLights(); // Call when lights change

// Blurred environment for faster convergence
import { BlurredEnvMapGenerator } from 'three-gpu-pathtracer';
const generator = new BlurredEnvMapGenerator(renderer);
const blurredEnvMap = generator.generate(envMap, 0.35);
```

7. **Denoising**:
```javascript
import { DenoiseMaterial } from 'three-gpu-pathtracer';

const denoiseMaterial = new DenoiseMaterial();
denoiseMaterial.sigma = 5.0;
denoiseMaterial.kSigma = 1.0;
denoiseMaterial.threshold = 0.03;
// Apply as post-processing pass
```

## Performance Comparison

### Current Rasterization Approach
- **FPS**: 60fps constant (real-time)
- **Quality**: Good with limitations (no global illumination, shadow map artifacts)
- **Interactivity**: Instant response to camera/scene changes
- **Use Case**: Product visualization, turntable animation

### Path Tracing (evanw approach)
- **FPS**: Variable (depends on scene complexity)
- **Quality**: Excellent (physically accurate)
- **Interactivity**: Shader recompilation on changes (500ms-2s)
- **Use Case**: Static high-quality renders

### Path Tracing (three-gpu-pathtracer)
- **FPS**: 1-10 samples/sec initially, converges over time
- **Quality**: Photorealistic (physically accurate)

## Integration Strategy for 3D Model Viewer

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid Rendering System

Implement **dual rendering modes** in the existing viewer:

1. **Rasterization Mode (Default)** - Current implementation
   - Real-time interaction
   - Turntable animation
   - Quick preview
   - Use for: UI interaction, model inspection

2. **Path Tracing Mode (Optional)** - New feature
   - High-quality rendering
   - Progressive refinement
   - Photorealistic output
   - Use for: Final renders, export, presentation

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Basic Integration (Week 1-2)**
```javascript
// Add to ModelViewer class
import { WebGLPathTracer } from 'three-gpu-pathtracer';

class ModelViewer {
    constructor() {
        // ... existing code ...
        this.pathTracer = null;
        this.pathTracingEnabled = false;
    }

    enablePathTracing() {
        if (!this.pathTracer) {
            this.pathTracer = new WebGLPathTracer(this.renderer);
            this.pathTracer.bounces = 10;
            this.pathTracer.tiles = new THREE.Vector2(2, 2);
            this.pathTracer.rasterizeScene = true; // Hybrid mode
        }

        this.pathTracer.setScene(this.scene, this.camera);
        this.pathTracingEnabled = true;
    }

    animate() {
        requestAnimationFrame(() => this.animate());

        if (this.pathTracingEnabled) {
            // Path tracing mode
            this.pathTracer.renderSample();
        } else {
            // Standard rasterization
            this.render();
        }
    }
}
```

**Phase 2: UI Controls (Week 2-3)**
- Toggle button: Rasterization ↔ Path Tracing
- Quality presets: Fast (5 bounces) / Medium (10 bounces) / High (15 bounces)
- Sample counter display
- "Reset" button to restart progressive rendering
- "Render to completion" option (auto-stop at N samples)

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3-4)**
- Depth of field controls (integrate PhysicalCamera)
- Denoising post-process
- Export high-quality path-traced renders
- Blurred environment map optimization
- Adaptive sampling (focus samples on noisy areas)

**Phase 4: Optimization & Polish (Week 4)**
- Tiled rendering for large exports
- Background rendering (continue path tracing when idle)
- Preset management (save/load quality settings)
- Performance profiling and tuning
- Documentation updates

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Browser Compatibility
**WebGL 2.0 Support**:
- Chrome/Edge: ✅ Full support (2017+)
- Firefox: ✅ Full support (2017+)
- Safari: ✅ Support since 15.0 (2021)
- Mobile: ⚠️ Limited (iOS 15+, Android Chrome)

**Fallback Strategy**:
```javascript
if (!renderer.capabilities.isWebGL2) {
    console.warn('WebGL 2.0 not supported, path tracing disabled');
    // Disable path tracing UI controls
    return false;
}
```

### 2. Memory Considerations
- BVH structure: ~10MB for 100K triangles
- Texture atlases: Configured via `textureSize` (default: 1024x1024)
- Render buffers: 2x screen resolution (double buffering)
- Total overhead: ~50-200MB depending on scene complexity

### 3. Performance Optimization

**For Current Viewer Use Case** (product visualization):
```javascript
// Optimized configuration
pathTracer.bounces = 8; // Good balance for product viz
pathTracer.tiles = new THREE.Vector2(2, 2); // Responsive tiling
pathTracer.rasterizeScene = true; // Show preview immediately
pathTracer.dynamicLowRes = true; // Low-res preview during camera movement
pathTracer.lowResScale = 0.25; // 25% resolution preview
pathTracer.minSamples = 10; // Minimum samples before display
pathTracer.renderDelay = 100; // Delay to allow camera to settle
```

**Turntable Animation Compatibility**:
- Option 1: Disable turntable during path tracing
- Option 2: Render turntable frames offline (export workflow)
- Option 3: Low sample count animation (noisy but real-time)

### 4. HDRI Integration
The existing HDRI system integrates seamlessly:
```javascript
// Current implementation (already working)
scene.environment = envMap;
scene.environmentRotation.set(0, rotation, 0);

// Path tracer uses the same environment
pathTracer.setScene(scene, camera);
pathTracer.updateEnvironment(); // Call after env changes
```

**Optimization**:
```javascript
// Generate blurred env map for faster convergence
import { BlurredEnvMapGenerator } from 'three-gpu-pathtracer';

const generator = new BlurredEnvMapGenerator(this.renderer);
const blurredEnv = generator.generate(this.originalHDRITexture, 0.35);
scene.environment = blurredEnv; // Use for path tracing
```

### 5. Export Workflow Enhancement

**Current Export**: PNG/MP4 with rasterized rendering
**Enhanced Export**: High-quality path-traced renders

```javascript
async exportPathTracedPNG(targetSamples = 1000) {
    // Enable path tracing
    this.enablePathTracing();
    this.pathTracer.reset();

    // Render samples until target reached
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        const renderLoop = () => {
            this.pathTracer.renderSample();

            if (this.pathTracer.samples >= targetSamples) {
                // Export completed render
                const dataURL = this.canvas.toDataURL('image/png');
                resolve(dataURL);
            } else {
                requestAnimationFrame(renderLoop);
            }
        };
        renderLoop();
    });
}
```

## Comparison with Current Implementation

### Current 3D Viewer (Rasterization + HDRI IBL)

**Lighting Approach**:
- HDRI environment map for reflections (Image-Based Lighting)
- Directional sun light extracted from HDRI brightest point
- Shadow mapping (PCF soft shadows, 2048x2048 quality)
- Ambient light fallback

**Strengths**:
- Real-time 60fps rendering
- Instant camera response
- Smooth turntable animation
- Good material appearance with PBR

**Limitations**:
- No global illumination (light doesn't bounce between objects)
- Shadow map artifacts (Peter-panning, aliasing)
- Limited soft shadow quality (shadow map resolution)
- No caustics or light scattering
- Reflections limited to environment map (no inter-object reflections)

### With Path Tracing Integration

**Enhanced Lighting**:
- Physically accurate global illumination
- Soft shadows naturally from area lights
- Accurate inter-object reflections
- Caustics through transparent/refractive objects
- Subsurface scattering support
- Natural ambient occlusion

**Quality Improvements**:
- Photorealistic product renders
- Accurate material representation
- Professional marketing imagery
- Enhanced realism for presentations

**Workflow**:
- Use rasterization for interaction/preview
- Switch to path tracing for final quality renders
- Export high-quality marketing materials
- Best of both worlds approach

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Basic Path Tracing Toggle

```javascript
// Add to 3d-ui.js
document.getElementById('enable-pathtracing').addEventListener('change', (e) => {
    if (e.target.checked) {
        viewer.enablePathTracing();
        document.getElementById('samples-counter').style.display = 'block';
    } else {
        viewer.disablePathTracing();
        document.getElementById('samples-counter').style.display = 'none';
    }
});

// Add to 3d-viewer.js
enablePathTracing() {
    if (!this.renderer.capabilities.isWebGL2) {
        alert('Path tracing requires WebGL 2.0 support');
        return false;
    }

    if (!this.pathTracer) {
        this.pathTracer = new WebGLPathTracer(this.renderer);
        this.pathTracer.bounces = 10;
        this.pathTracer.tiles = new THREE.Vector2(2, 2);
        this.pathTracer.rasterizeScene = true;
        this.pathTracer.minSamples = 5;
    }

    this.pathTracer.setScene(this.scene, this.camera);
    this.pathTracingEnabled = true;

    // Disable turntable during path tracing
    this.turntableEnabled = false;

    console.log('✅ Path tracing enabled');
}

disablePathTracing() {
    this.pathTracingEnabled = false;
    console.log('✅ Path tracing disabled');
}
```

    fast: {
        bounces: 5,
        tiles: new THREE.Vector2(3, 3),
        minSamples: 3,
        targetSamples: 50,
    },
    medium: {
        bounces: 10,
        tiles: new THREE.Vector2(2, 2),
        minSamples: 5,
        targetSamples: 200,

        if (samplesDisplay) {
            const current = this.pathTracer.samples;
            const target = this.targetSamples || 'unlimited';
            samplesDisplay.textContent = `Samples: ${current} / ${target}`;

            // Auto-stop at target (optional)
            if (this.targetSamples && current >= this.targetSamples) {
                console.log(`✅ Path tracing complete: ${current} samples`);
                // Optionally stop rendering to save power
            }
        }
    } else {
